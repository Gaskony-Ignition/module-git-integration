# Changelog

Gaskony builds of the OperaMetrix Git module. Versions up to 2.1.0 are
upstream's; everything below is this fork.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed
- The History tab's footer read "Showing 0 of 0 items" beside a full list of commits. The grid
  counts from its pagination parameters rather than its rows, and they defaulted to zero; every
  loaded commit is on one page, so the footer is now hidden.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-09-14

Event delivery and Outbound triggers are removed. Scheduled sync and the Actions runner stay, and
the Automation page now says which direction everything on it goes. Removing features is a
breaking change, hence 3.0.0.

### Removed
- **Event delivery** — raising a git operation into a project-library function or a Gateway Event
  message handler. Commits and pushes are made in the Designer, which already reports their
  outcome, so this was a second channel for the same information.
- **Outbound triggers** — HTTP rules, with GitHub `repository_dispatch` / `workflow_dispatch`
  presets, fired on a matching git event. A GitHub remote already starts workflows on push, and
  release delivery belongs to a deployment pipeline rather than to the gateway that was edited.
- Routes `POST /automation`, `/automation-test`, `/trigger`, `/trigger-remove`.
- `GET /automation` no longer returns `settings`, `allTypes`, `triggers`, `delivery` (per log
  entry), or `dropped`/`queued`/`running` (in `stats`).
- The four event types that were advertised but never raised: `fetch`, `checkout`, `branch`,
  `revert`. Only `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `autocommit` and `sync` were ever fired — a runner pull
  logs as `sync`.

### Changed
- The Automation page states plainly which direction everything goes: **"Automation: pulling
  changes in"**. Everything left on it (Scheduled sync, Actions runner) brings a project's remote
  down onto this gateway; pushing happens in the Designer, and gateway config is pushed from the
  Remote Sync button above.
- Event log's **Delivery** column is replaced by **Details**, which now also carries the remote
  name — the diagnostic for delivery paths that no longer exist is gone, and the diagnostic for an
  unattended sync's outcome is more specific. **Clear** now also resets the event and failure
  counts shown beside it, which previously kept a lifetime total above an emptied table.
- The Actions runner tab warns when the selected project has no Scheduled sync record — the
  runner route 404s without one, since a runner pull borrows that record's branch and credential —
  and disables *Commit the workflow to the repository* until one exists.
- The runner tab gives Linux and Windows (PowerShell) versions of both the install block and the
  reachability check. On Windows PowerShell 5.1 `curl` is an alias for `Invoke-WebRequest`, so the
  old check failed there for reasons unrelated to the gateway. The runner version is now 2.337.0.
- Runner labels typed with spaces (`self-hosted, ignition`) are normalised before they reach
  `config.sh`/`config.cmd`. Pasted raw, the space split them into two arguments and registration
  failed.
- The generated workflow runs on Linux and Windows self-hosted runners: two steps gated on
  `runner.os`, a bash/curl one and a pwsh/`Invoke-RestMethod` one. The previous single bash step
  failed on a Windows runner, whose default shell is pwsh.

### Upgrade
- On first start, the gateway deletes the retired `git-automation` and `git-trigger` resources,
  plus the `git-webhook` resource left over from the 2.14.0 removal, and the deletion lands as one
  config-repository commit. A resource it cannot delete is logged at WARN and retried on the next
  start. The config repository's history is **not** rewritten, so **rotate any
  token that was ever typed into a trigger's headers** — it remains readable in that repository's
  history.

### Breaking
- Any saved trigger or event-delivery handler stops working. There is no migration: both features
  are gone, not disabled.

## [2.18.0] - 2026-09-10

Both of these were found by running the loop for real — a GitHub repository, a registered
self-hosted runner, and a push to the default branch driving this gateway. Neither was visible
from the module side alone.

### Fixed
- **The generated workflow triggered on `main`, but project-init creates `master`.** A workflow
  whose trigger names a branch the repository does not have raises no error and produces no run —
  it simply never fires, which is precisely the silent failure the setup generator exists to
  prevent. The trigger is now the project's own branch, read from its repository.

### Added
- **A credential can be attached to a project's remote from the gateway page.** The association
  lived only in the Designer's Remotes popup, so the Projects tab could set a remote it could never
  authenticate to, and a project "set up without opening a Designer" still needed one before it
  could fetch or push. `POST /project-credential`, and the credential picker in the Projects drawer
  now shows for versioned projects instead of only during initialisation.

### Verified end to end
A public throwaway repository, a self-hosted runner registered with the generated `config.sh`
command verbatim, and the gateway's own committed workflow. A push to `master` at 03:31:00Z reached
the gateway at 03:31:11Z: the run reported `{"ok":true,"project":"_runner_live_","result":"pulled 2
file(s)"}`, the files were on disk, the project came back clean, and the sync event logged
`Pulled 2 changed file(s) from origin/master`. The runner, the repository and the fixtures were
removed afterwards.

## [2.17.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added
- **The gateway commits the sync workflow itself.** It already holds push rights for the project
  repository — that is how project versioning works at all — so asking someone to copy a generated
  file into it by hand was a step with no purpose. *Commit the workflow to the repository* writes
  `.github/workflows/ignition-sync.yml`, commits it through the ordinary project-commit path (so it
  raises the same git event and lands in the same history as any other commit) and pushes.

  It refuses to overwrite a workflow that is already there and differs, since that file may have
  gained steps that have nothing to do with this module; re-running it when nothing has changed
  reports `unchanged` rather than making an empty commit. A commit that cannot be pushed is
  reported as exactly that — the commit stands and the push reason is shown — rather than failing
  the whole operation.

  Setup is now three steps: generate a token, save it in the repository as `IGNITION_SYNC_TOKEN`
  (the tab names the secret), and run the install block on the runner machine.

## [2.16.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added
- **A GitHub Actions self-hosted runner can now ask the gateway to pull, and the module generates
  the setup for it.** Automation gained an *Actions runner* tab. A runner is a service on your own
  network that connects *out* to GitHub and is handed workflow jobs over that same connection, so
  a merge can reach the gateway within seconds without anything reaching in — which is what the
  webhook removed in 2.14.0 could never do without a public address or a tunnel.

  The tab generates the four things that have to agree across two systems and three files: the
  `config.sh` registration command carrying the project's own repository URL and the runner
  labels, the workflow YAML targeting those same labels, the trigger token, and the `curl` that
  proves the runner can reach the gateway before any workflow depends on it. Each is a copyable
  block. Getting one of them subtly wrong is what produces a workflow that queues forever with no
  error, which is the failure this exists to prevent.

  `POST /runner-sync` is the route the runner calls. It is the only route in the module with no
  permission check and no CSRF token, because a workflow step has neither a gateway session nor a
  way to obtain one, so it authenticates itself: a bearer token compared in constant time, a 64 KB
  body cap, and a 404 to everyone until a token is generated. The token is generated by the
  gateway, stored encrypted as a `SecretConfig`, and returned exactly once — there is no endpoint
  that reads it back.

  A runner-requested sync runs even when the project's *scheduled* sync is switched off: turning
  the timer off says "pull on demand only", not "never pull".

  The module deliberately does not install or supervise the runner itself. A runner executes
  whatever the workflow file says, so hosting one from inside the module would put
  repository-supplied shell next to the project store under the gateway's own identity, and would
  need a stored GitHub admin credential to keep re-fetching hourly registration tokens.

## [2.15.0] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- **Form fields on the Versioning page had no visible label.** The platform's `TextInput`,
  `SelectInput` and `TextArea` accept a `label` and render it only into MUI's notched-outline
  legend, which ships at opacity 0 — it exists to cut the notch, not to be read. Measured on 8.3.8:
  27 fields across Credentials, Projects and Automation had their label text present in the DOM and
  invisible on screen, so what you were typing into was inferred from placeholder text and the
  prose around it. Forcing the legend opaque only clips it against the border, so the label is now
  painted above the control instead.

  `web-ui/src/pages/GitConfig/fields.tsx` wraps the three inputs and every existing `label=` call
  site works unchanged — import them from `./fields`, not from `../../webui`. Present since the
  Credentials and Projects tabs shipped in 2.11.0.

### Documentation
- **The Automation screenshot in the README showed the Webhook tab**, removed in 2.14.0. Recaptured
  on this build, along with the Projects and Excluded files screenshots.
- **`CLAUDE.md` was two releases stale** — it still described six resource types (there are nine),
  listed 16 of the 30 REST routes, and said nothing about the automation feature at all. It now
  covers the event bus, the two delivery paths and their isolation, the scheduled sync, why polling
  is the inbound mechanism, the image-store tree walk and merge, and the platform-component traps
  that have now caused three separate page crashes.

## [2.14.0] - 2026-09-09

### Removed
- **The inbound GitHub webhook, added one release ago.** It worked — signed synthetic deliveries
  authenticated, replayed ones were rejected, and a matching project fast-forwarded — but it could
  never receive a delivery from GitHub on any gateway here.

  A webhook is GitHub opening a connection **to** the gateway. A credential cannot create an
  inbound route: an HTTPS token or an SSH key authenticates the gateway calling **out**, which is
  the direction that already works. Proving the feature meant putting a gateway on the public
  internet behind a tunnel, and running it meant every site doing the same.

  That left the module carrying a second inbound mechanism nobody could use, and the security
  surface of a route with no session and no permission check, to save a poll interval. Scheduled
  sync reaches the same state over the connection every gateway already has, so it is once again
  the only inbound path. The reasoning is kept in `docs/AUTOMATION.md` so it is not rebuilt by
  accident.

- Events no longer carry a `details` dictionary. It existed to hold the GitHub event name and a
  workflow run's conclusion; with the webhook gone nothing fills it, and an always-empty key in
  every payload is worse than no key.

### Kept from 2.13.0
The three defects found while building the webhook were real and older than it. They stay fixed:
non-ASCII in an event no longer stops delivery, script and trigger delivery no longer take each
other down, and opening *Add credential* no longer crashes the page. So does the image work — the
tree walk that made export function at all, and the per-project image folder.

## [2.13.0] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- **Inbound GitHub webhooks.** A repository can now post to the gateway instead of the gateway
  polling it. Every accepted delivery raises a `webhook` git event carrying the GitHub event
  name, the repository, the branch and the sender, so a Jython handler can act on any event type
  without a module upgrade. The event types named in the settings additionally fast-forward the
  matching project, using that project's Scheduled sync configuration for its credential and
  branch — so a schedule can be turned off and the webhook still drives the pull.

  `push` and `workflow_run` are the two the gateway understands by itself. `workflow_run` carries
  the run's name, status, conclusion and URL in `details`, which closes the loop with the outbound
  triggers: the gateway pushes, the Action runs, and the gateway hears how it went.

  This route is the only one in the module with no permission check and no CSRF token, because
  GitHub can present neither. It authenticates each request itself: HMAC-SHA256 over the raw body
  compared in constant time, replay rejection by delivery id, a 2 MB body cap, and a 404 to
  everyone until a secret is configured. The secret is stored encrypted and never returned to the
  browser.

  Scheduled sync remains the reliable path. A gateway GitHub cannot reach never receives a
  delivery, which is why polling was built first and stays the default.

- **Events carry a `details` dictionary** for anything without a column of its own. It reaches
  Jython as a nested dict and an outbound trigger template as `${details.conclusion}`.

### Changed
- **A project versions one named image folder, and the export actually works.** Two things were
  wrong here, and the second was only found by measuring the store.

  `exportImages` iterated `getImages("")` and wrote every entry straight to disk. But the 8.3 image
  store is a **tree**, and `getImages` lists one level of it, returning folders as entries with a
  null format and no bytes. On this gateway the entire root listing is the single folder entry
  `Builtin` — so the export wrote one empty file called `images/Builtin` and exported no image at
  all. It now walks the tree, with a depth and entry cap so a malformed store cannot hang a
  snapshot.

  On top of that, exporting was all-or-nothing across a gateway-wide resource. A project now names
  the one folder it versions (`Builtin/icons/16`, say) and exports only that; the default is empty,
  meaning it exports no images. Existing projects take the empty default.

  Import is unchanged and still merges, so narrowing or clearing a prefix never deletes anything
  from a gateway.

- **Images can be snapshotted from the gateway.** The Projects tab is where the folder is now
  chosen, so it is also where you can write it into the repository — configuring a prefix on the
  gateway and then having to open a Designer to act on it is a split nobody would design on
  purpose. The Designer's Commit panel button is unchanged.

### Fixed
- **One non-ASCII character stopped an event being delivered at all.** `Py.newString` rejects any
  character above 0xFF, so a commit message carrying an accented name, a curly quote pasted from a
  document, or an em dash threw while the Jython payload was being built — and the event reached
  neither the script handler nor the outbound trigger. Strings now go through
  `Py.newStringOrUnicode`. Found by measurement: a gateway-generated message containing an em dash
  did exactly this.
- **A failure in one delivery path no longer takes the other down.** Script delivery and outbound
  triggers ran in one unguarded block, so a payload Jython refused to build meant the trigger never
  fired either, and the event log named only the first failure. Each path is now isolated and
  reports its own outcome.
- **Opening the Add credential form crashed the whole page.** The platform's `Radio` is a radio
  *group* — it takes a `radios` array and maps over it — and it was used as four single radios with
  `label`/`checked`. It read `radios.map` on undefined and the page went to "Application Error".
  Present since the Credentials tab shipped in 2.11.0, and the same class of mistake as the
  `SelectInput` crash fixed in 2.12.1. Every tab and every form on the page is now swept for this
  before release.

- **`${…}` placeholders accept dots**, so the new `details` map is reachable from a trigger body as
  `${details.conclusion}`. The pattern matched letters only, and an unmatched placeholder is left
  as literal text — so a template referring to one silently posted the placeholder itself.

### Known
- **Field labels on these tabs are not painted.** The platform's `TextInput`/`SelectInput` accept a
  `label` but render it only into MUI's notched-outline legend, which ships at opacity 0 and is
  clipped by its own box even when made opaque — measured on 8.3.8. The webhook panel renders its
  own labels; the older forms still rely on placeholder text and surrounding prose. Unchanged from
  2.11, recorded here so it is not rediscovered.

- Nothing else in the module — but `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` now records why a Designer vanishes on
  macOS during a pull. It is [JDK-8372757](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8372757), a
  regression from JDK-8341311 present in JDK 17.0.17–17.0.20 and fixed in 17.0.21, and it needs a
  macOS accessibility client to be running. A pull is implicated only because it reliably supplies
  the garbage collection the reproduction calls for.

## [2.12.6] - 2026-09-09

### Changed
- **Importing images now merges instead of replacing.** A pull or clone adds and updates
  the images the project carries and leaves everything else in the gateway store alone.
  Previously the whole store was cleared first, which made one project's `images/` folder
  authoritative for a resource that is gateway-wide, not per project — so importing a
  project could delete another project's images even when the import itself succeeded.
  2.12.5 stopped the empty-snapshot case; this removes the destructive behaviour entirely.

  An image dropped from a project therefore stays on the gateway and needs deleting by
  hand. That is the deliberate trade: a stale image is a tidy-up, someone else's deleted
  image is a restore from backup.

  Imports are also idempotent now — an image already present with identical bytes is
  skipped rather than re-inserted, so a routine pull no longer churns the whole store.

## [2.12.5] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed
- **Cloning a project no longer wipes the gateway's image library.** `importImages`
  cleared the ENTIRE gateway image store and then uploaded whatever the project
  carried in `images/`. The store is gateway-scoped, not per project, so a project
  with no `images/` folder cleared it and restored nothing — deleting the platform's
  704 Builtin icons and any other project's images along with them. The clone path
  calls this unconditionally, so it happened on the first clone. It now returns
  early when the project has no snapshot to import, matching `importTagManager` and
  `importTheme`, which have always no-opped in that case.

  A project that *does* carry `images/` still replaces the whole gateway store, which
  is upstream's deliberate design. That remains a sharp edge: it is a gateway-wide
  operation driven by one project's contents.

## [2.12.4] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed
- **Cloning a project this gateway has never had now works.** The import step called
  `createOrReplace`, which refuses a non-empty directory for a collection Ignition
  does not already know — and a clone produces exactly that. The files landed, the
  call threw *"exists but is not empty"*, and the rollback removed the repository
  and the config records while leaving the checked-out files on disk. A project new
  to the gateway is now adopted from disk by a scan instead. Replacing an existing
  project is unchanged.

## [2.12.3] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed
- **A resource deleted on the remote no longer survives a clone.** The checkout's
  cleanup was `git.clean().setForce(true)` — `git clean -f` with no `-d` — and JGit
  leaves an entirely untracked directory alone, as does `reset --hard`. A view
  removed from the remote therefore stayed on disk through the checkout and came
  back as *Added* in the pulling gateway's Changes list. Cleanup now sets
  `setCleanDirectories(true)`; ignored files are still left alone.

## [2.12.2] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed
- **Dropdown selections are saved.** The platform's `SelectInput` spreads its rest
  props onto a MUI Select, so `onChange` receives MUI's event, not the chosen value.
  Reading it as a string stored the event object instead, and the save then failed on
  the gateway with `UnsupportedOperationException: JsonObject` — a 500 naming a Gson
  type rather than the field at fault. As with the `values` prop, the same mistake was
  in the Credentials and Projects tabs shipped in 2.11.0.
- `optString` ignores a non-primitive field instead of throwing, so a wrong-shaped
  request can no longer produce an opaque 500.

## [2.12.1] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed
- **Dropdowns render instead of blanking the page.** The platform's `SelectInput`
  takes its items as `values`, not `options`; with the wrong prop it read `.find` off
  `undefined` and React unmounted the whole page to "Application Error". This also
  fixes two paths shipped in 2.11.0 that had the same mistake and were never exercised:
  choosing a stored secret on the Credentials tab, and picking a credential when
  cloning from the Projects tab. Both blanked the page as soon as the dropdown
  appeared.

## [2.12.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added
- **Automation tab** on the Versioning page — three things that previously needed
  scripts written on a gateway you could already reach.
- **Git events.** Every commit, push, pull, checkout, branch, revert and config
  auto-commit raises an event, successes and failures alike, delivered to a project
  library function and/or a Gateway Event message handler as a dictionary. Failures
  carry the reason, because "the nightly push has been failing for a week" is the
  thing worth knowing. Delivery is asynchronous on a bounded queue: a broken handler
  cannot slow a commit down, let alone fail one.
- **Outbound triggers.** A matching event calls a URL, with GitHub's
  `repository_dispatch` and `workflow_dispatch` as one-click presets. Generic on
  purpose — the same rule shape serves GitLab, Jenkins, Teams or another gateway.
  Owner and repo are derived from the repository's own remote, so one rule can serve
  every project. The token is a stored HTTPS credential referenced by id, never held
  in the rule and never logged.
- **Scheduled sync.** The gateway fetches each enabled project repository on a timer
  and fast-forwards when the tracked branch has moved, then requests a project scan.
  Polling rather than a GitHub webhook is deliberate: a webhook needs GitHub to reach
  *into* the gateway, which is not possible on most OT networks. A sync refuses when
  the working tree has local changes rather than discarding someone's unsaved work,
  and one repository syncs at a time.
- **Event log** on the same tab — the last 50 events and what the gateway did with
  each, which is where a handler that silently does nothing becomes visible.

### Fixed
- `checkoutRemote` honours the remote it was given. It hardcoded `origin`, so a pull
  on an unborn repository configured with a differently named remote would silently
  contact the wrong one.

## [2.11.1] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed
- **Initialize-from-remote no longer strands a project on an unborn branch.** An init
  that failed after creating `.git` — a token awaiting approval, say — left the
  directory behind when it rolled its records back. The retry then registered the
  project and skipped the clone, because the check for existing work was "does `.git`
  exist" rather than "does this repository have a commit". The project sat on an
  unborn `master` with every resource showing as a change, and Pull asked the remote
  for a branch that had never existed there: *Remote origin did not advertise Ref for
  branch master*.

  An existing `.git` with no HEAD is now treated as an unfinished clone and completed,
  a `.git` created by a failed attempt is deleted so the retry starts clean, and Pull
  on a repository with no HEAD finishes the clone instead of running a merge. A
  project already in this state recovers with one Pull after upgrading.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added
- **Credentials tab** on the Versioning page. SSH keys and HTTPS credentials could
  only be created from the Designer's setup wizard, which put them behind the thing
  they are needed for: you cannot clone a project without a key, and you could not
  make the key without opening a Designer. The gateway routes already existed and
  nothing called them.
- **Projects tab** listing every project on the gateway with its branch, remote and
  uncommitted count, and whether it is under version control at all. Unversioned
  projects are listed too — "not in git" and "not on this gateway" are otherwise
  indistinguishable. A project can be initialised, cloned, or given a remote from
  here without opening a Designer.

### Fixed
- The page no longer hides everything behind "config versioning is not initialized".
  That gate is specific to the History and Excluded files tabs, and applying it to
  the whole page put the credentials you need BEFORE any setup behind the setup you
  cannot do without them.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-09-08

### Changed
- The Changes list and the Project Browser badges refresh when you save, rather
  than on the next tick of the 15-second poll. Saving is when the change set
  changes, so waiting on a timer (or pressing refresh) was the wrong default.
  The poll remains as a backstop.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed
- Change badges no longer overlap the resource name. The dot is drawn on the
  corner of the resource's icon instead of after its text: the nav tree's
  renderer sizes itself from icon and text and ignores a border's insets, so the
  trailing space the badge relied on was never reserved.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed
- A nested git repository is no longer reported as a config change. `config/`
  can contain one, which left the repository permanently dirty and produced an
  empty commit on every config change.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-09-07

### Changed
- The Excluded files tree is rooted at `config/` — the only path the repository
  versions — and opens its top level. Rooted at the data directory it showed
  forty rows of runtime state with the versioned folder collapsed among them.
- The tree box is sized to its content rather than always claiming the window.
- Renamed to "Git Integration" with a Gaskony description. The module id and the
  `com.operametrix.*` packages are unchanged so upstream merges still apply.

### Fixed
- Commits stage exactly the paths the change list reports. They previously
  staged the whole data directory, so databases, caches and logs were committed
  silently while the change list showed only `config/`.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed
- Badges keep rendering after the first commit of a Designer session. They are
  drawn by a border rather than through the platform's badge collection, which
  silently stops painting once a commit has been made.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added
- Deleted resources show as a red badge on the ancestor folder. A deleted
  resource has no tree node left, so the roll-up is the only place it can appear.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added
- Change badges in the Designer's Project Browser: green created, amber changed,
  with a roll-up on ancestor folders.
- Excluded files tab on the gateway Versioning page — a tree of the data
  directory where a tick means versioned, editing `.gitignore` directly.

### Fixed
- `initRepo` no longer races the tag value store. The scan listed
  `valueStore.idb-wal`, SQLite deleted it, and the add died with
  `FileNotFoundException` — so config versioning could never be initialised on a
  running gateway. `*-wal` and `*-shm` are now ignored.
