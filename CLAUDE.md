# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Ignition Git Module — a Java module for the Inductive Automation Ignition SCADA platform (8.3.0+) that embeds a Git client into the Ignition Designer. It supports commit, push, fetch (without merge), pull (with merge-conflict resolution), revert, branch management, snapshotting gateway-side resources (tags/themes/images) into the project, and both remote (clone) and local-only repository initialization — all from the Designer's dockable panels and status bar. It also versions the **gateway data directory** (config-as-code) in a separate repo, surfaced through a dedicated React **gateway web page** (Platform → System → "Versioning") — config changes are auto-committed as they happen; the page provides history/restore. Originally built by AXONE-IO, maintained by Operametrix.

## Build Commands

```bash
./gradlew build           # produces build/Git.modl (also builds the web-ui React bundle)
./gradlew :web-ui:webpack # build only the gateway web page bundle
```

The `:web-ui` subproject uses the `com.github.node-gradle.node` plugin to download Node 18 and run yarn/webpack; the first build needs network access (IA Nexus node-packages registry + nodejs.org). To auto-fix ESLint/Prettier formatting (the webpack build fails on Prettier violations), run `node_modules/.bin/prettier --write "src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"` from `web-ui/`.

No automated tests. Testing is manual: install the `.modl` on an Ignition gateway and exercise the Designer UI and the gateway Versioning page.

## Architecture

Gradle multi-module project following the **Ignition Module SDK pattern**:

```
common    (scope: DG)   — RPC interface + abstract delegation base
designer  (scope: D)    — Designer UI: dockable panels, popups, status bar
gateway   (scope: G)    — all git operations + persistence + config-as-code REST routes
web-ui    (no scope)    — React gateway page (config-as-code), bundled into the gateway jar
```

Scopes: D = Designer, G = Gateway. The Vision client scope is unused — there is no `system.git.*` script module on Vision clients. The root `build.gradle.kts` (`io.ia.sdk.modl` plugin) assembles the `.modl`.

### Key design patterns

**Hooks** are the per-scope entry points (Ignition `setup`/`startup`/`shutdown`):
- `DesignerHook` — builds the status bar, the dockable Commit/History panels, and a user-verification timer; talks to the gateway via `GatewayConnection.getRpcInterface(...)`. If `isProjectRegistered()` is false it shows a minimal "Configure" + user-button bar so credentials can be added before init; after init via `InitRepoPopup` it calls `reinitializeAfterSetup()` to build the full bar. A 1-second `panelVisibilityTimer` re-shows the Commit/History panels across workspace switches (checks hidden / null-in-DockingManager / `!isDisplayable()`). Exposes a static `instance` for `GitActionManager` callbacks.
- `GatewayHook` — registers the eight resource types and starts their `NamedResourceHandler`s, runs the one-time legacy SimpleORM→resource importer, and registers the gateway RPC implementation (`getRpcImplementation()`). Also wires the config-as-code feature: registers the React page in the `NavigationModel` (Platform → System → "Versioning"), overrides `getMountPathAlias()` (`git-config`) / `getMountedResourceFolder()` (`mounted`), and mounts the REST routes in `mountRouteHandlers(RouteGroup)`.

**RPC pattern** (8.3 module RPC): `GitScriptInterface` (common) is the contract, annotated `@RpcInterface(packageId="com.operametrix.ignition.git")` and exposing a shared `SERIALIZER`. The serializer is a custom `ProtoRpcSerializer.newBuilder()` instance — `DEFAULT_INSTANCE` has no `Dataset` support, so it registers a Java-serialization `BinaryAdapter` for `Dataset`/`BasicDataset` (`ObjectSerializers.forUnsafeObject`); without it every `Dataset`-returning RPC round-trips empty with no error. `AbstractScriptModule` (common) is a plain abstract base that delegates each interface method to a `…Impl` abstract method, supplied by `GatewayScriptModule` (gateway) — which must `implements GitScriptInterface` *directly* (8.3's `RpcDelegate` discovers `@RpcInterface` only on the concrete class's direct interfaces, no superclass walk). The gateway registers it via `GatewayHook.getRpcImplementation()` → `GatewayRpcImplementation.of(SERIALIZER, scriptModule)`; the Designer obtains a proxy via `GatewayConnection.getRpcInterface(SERIALIZER, "com.operametrix.ignition.git", GitScriptInterface.class)`.

**Designer project refresh**: after any gateway-side operation that mutates the Ignition project (pull, checkout, init, snapshot), the Designer must call `GitBaseAction.pullProjectFromGateway()`. Under 8.3's resource model this (a) discards stale local edits per `ChangeOperation` via typed `DesignableProject.discardChanges(ResourcePath)` — so a deliberate checkout doesn't open the Resolve-Conflicts dialog (the gateway is authoritative; uncommitted work is preserved by gateway-side git stash/restore) — then (b) reflectively calls the public `IgnitionDesigner.updateProject()`, the 8.3 successor to the removed private `pullAndResolve()`. `closeAllEditorTabs()` runs first and looks up `TabbedResourceWorkspace.close(common.resourcecollection.ResourcePath, boolean)` (the 8.3 resource overhaul moved `ResourcePath` from `common.project.resource.*` to `common.resourcecollection.*`). Without this refresh the gateway changes (via `GitProjectManager.importProject()`) won't show in the Designer.

**Gateway data-directory versioning (config-as-code)** — a *separate* git repo from the per-project repos, rooted at the data directory itself (`<dataDir>/.git`, via `GitManager.getDataFolderPath()`). It tracks gateway config (primarily `<dataDir>/config/`) using a `.gitignore` based on IA's version-control-guide template **plus `projects/`** excluded — so the per-project repos under `projects/` are untouched (no nesting/submodules). Orchestrated by `DataDirGitManager` (gateway), a thin static layer over the working-dir-agnostic `GitManager` primitives:
- `isInitialized()` = `<dataDir>/.git` exists (no persistence record; repo state lives in `.git`). `initRepo` is explicit (never auto-run at startup) — `git init` + write `.gitignore` + baseline commit.
- `getStatus()` is a plain porcelain listing scoped to `config`/`.gitignore` (the project-resource `hasActor/getActor/filterMetadataOnlyChanges` helpers must **not** be applied to config files); JSON key-ordering noise is suppressed via `GitManager.filterJsonOrderingChanges`.
- **Auto-commit**: `ConfigAutoCommitter`, a `ResourceCollectionListener` registered via `ConfigurationManager.addListener` in `GatewayHook.startup` — the manager-level listener is the only live notification surface; per-resource `ResourceListener`s on `getConfigCollection()` are **never notified** (that call builds a snapshot per invocation). Events within a 2s quiesce window coalesce, so one gateway operation plus its follow-up resources (e.g. a device's System tag definitions) lands as one commit via `commitAllIfDirty` (no-op on a clean tree, so the post-restore scan doesn't double-commit; gitignored `local` collection skipped). Manager events carry no resource detail, so the message (changed files grouped into resource dirs) comes from the git status; the author is the **gateway system name**. `commitLeftovers()` runs 10s after startup to sweep changes made while the gateway/module was offline (the one case the listener can't see — even IaC disk edits go through Scan File System, which fires the listener). There is **no manual commit**: no `/commit` route, and the page is history + restore only (no Uncommitted Changes panel).
- **Restore** = `GitManager.restoreTree(path, hash)` (resets the working tree/index to *exactly* the target tree — overwrites dirty tracked files, removes tracked files added since, and `git clean`s untracked non-ignored files so uncommitted changes are discarded; **keeps HEAD on the branch** — unlike the detaching `checkoutCommit`) then a forward "Restore config to <shortHash>" commit, then `applyConfigToRunningGateway()` = `GatewayContext.getConfigurationManager().requestScan().join()`, which applies the on-disk config to the running gateway **with no restart**. A single static `DATA_DIR_LOCK` serializes commit/restore/status against concurrent gateway config writes.
- **Remote (manual sync only)**: `GitConfigRemoteRecord` is a gateway-level singleton (URI, branch — default `main`, credential FK). `DataDirGitManager.push()` pushes `HEAD:refs/heads/<branch>` and advances the local `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>` tracking ref; **no auto-push** — only the header's **Remote Sync** button (`Refresh` icon). `GET /remote` returns `ahead` = `DataDirGitManager.aheadCount()` (commits on HEAD not reachable from the tracking ref); the header shows a bold "N not synced" (`var(--warning)`) / "✓ Up to date" indicator and the Sync button is primary only when diverged (the query polls 15s so the count tracks auto-commits). The History list badges only the two branch-tip commits — **Local** (HEAD, `alt` chip) / **Remote** (tracking ref, neutral `info` chip) — like git ref pointers.
- **Config UI = a lateral drawer** (`RemoteSync` header + `ConfigDrawer`), styled like the platform Redundancy page: a primary **"Configure Versioning"** button (trailing `SettingsGw` cog) opens a right-anchored `Drawer` + `DrawerTemplate` (`theme=GREY`, `size=SMALL`) whose body is `Form` + `FormControlInput` + `Card` sections (react-hook-form; `react-hook-form` is a shared webpack **external**). The remote's secret is entered **inline** (no credential dropdown, no popup): an **Embedded/Referenced** `Radio`, then either the typed secret or provider/secret `TextAutocomplete`s (disabled + red "No Providers Exist" when none). No credential name is asked — `handleSaveRemote` creates/updates **one dedicated credential record in place** (auto-named `Config repository (<host>)`) from the inline secret and links it; `handleGetRemote` returns mode/username/referenced-provider/secret for prefill (never the embedded secret); `handleTestRemote` tests with the inline secret via `GitManager.setAuthenticationRaw` (referenced secrets resolved through `Secret.create`), falling back to the saved credential when editing without re-entering. A **Danger Zone** card (red header) holds **Delete versioning** → `POST /deinit` → `DataDirGitManager.deleteRepo()` (removes `<dataDir>/.git` + `.gitignore` + remote record, **keeps** credentials). WebUI **confirm** modals must use `modalConfig.confirmationText` (NOT `descriptionText`, which only renders for `type:"primary"`); `FormControlInput`'s `disabled` only greys the label — disable the input via `otherProps={{disabled}}`.
- Caveat: inline encrypted secrets in `config/` are tied to the gateway's encryption key (keystore/certs are gitignored) — same-gateway restore only; the web page's Restore dialog warns about this and about live-resource reconfiguration.

- **Excluded files (`.gitignore` management)** — Gaskony fork, 07/09/2026. The page body is tabbed
  **History | Excluded files**; the second tab is a lazily-expanding tree of the data directory
  where a tick means "versioned". Backed by `GET /tree?path=` (one directory level:
  name/directory/`excluded`/`tracked`/`rule`/`ownRule`/`childState`/`reincludable`),
  `GET /ignore` (raw text) and `POST /ignore` (either `{text}` wholesale, or `{exclude, include}`
  tick edits). Four things it must keep doing, each learned the hard way:
  (a) **excluding a TRACKED path also runs `git rm --cached`** — a `.gitignore` line has no effect
  on a file git already tracks, so without it the page claims an exclusion that never happened;
  (b) appends go under a `# --- managed by the Versioning page below this line ---` marker and
  **existing lines are never rewritten or reordered** — re-including a glob-excluded path adds a
  negation (`!/p/` plus `!/p/**`, since a rule like `**/certificates/*` excludes the CONTENTS, not
  the folder) rather than deleting the glob, because deleting `**/logs` to recover one file is how
  a gateway starts versioning a gigabyte of logs;
  (c) git **cannot re-include anything under an excluded DIRECTORY**, so `decide()` reports whether
  an ancestor settled the path and the row goes read-only (`reincludable: false`) instead of
  offering a tick that would silently do nothing;
  (d) a folder can be included while everything in it is excluded (`**/db/*` excludes contents, not
  the directory) — the folder's tick comes from its `childState` roll-up, not its own flag, or the
  UI lies. The roll-up prunes at excluded directories (which is what makes it cheap: the huge
  directories are the excluded ones) and gives up after `ROLLUP_BUDGET` entries, reporting
  `UNKNOWN`. Edits accumulate client-side and are sent as ONE request, so a session of ticking is
  one `.gitignore` write and one auto-commit.
- **`GITIGNORE_LINES` must ignore the SQLite sidecars `*-wal` and `*-shm`** (Gaskony fork, 07/09/2026).
  Without them `initRepo`'s baseline `git add .` races the tag value store: the scan lists
  `config/ignition/tags/valueStore.idb-wal`, SQLite checkpoints and deletes it, and the add dies
  with `FileNotFoundException` — so init could **never** complete on a gateway that was actually
  running. Ignoring `valueStore.idb` alone is not enough; the sidecars are separate paths.

The page is React (8.3 gateway pages are React-only via `NavigationModel`; Wicket config pages are gone, and there is **no** module-accessible API for a global banner-on-all-pages or a dynamic nav badge — verified against `gateway-api-8.3.6`). It talks to the gateway via REST routes mounted in `GatewayHook.mountRouteHandlers` (NOT the RPC interface), under `/data/git-config/…`. Config-as-code: `GET /status|/history|/commit-files|/file-diff|/remote|/secret-providers|/tree|/ignore`, `POST /restore|/init|/deinit|/remote|/remote-remove|/remote-test|/push|/ignore|/update-from-remote`. Projects and credentials: `GET /projects|/credentials`, `POST /project-init|/project-remote|/project-credential|/project-images|/project-snapshot-images|/credentials|/credential-remove`. `/project-credential` attaches a stored credential to a project remote (`setRemoteCredentialRefImpl`) — without it the Projects tab could set a remote it could never authenticate to, since the association previously existed only in the Designer's Remotes popup. Automation: `GET /automation|/runner`, `POST /automation-clear|/sync|/sync-now|/runner|/runner-workflow|/runner-sync`. **`POST /runner-sync` is the one route with no permission check and no CSRF token** — a GitHub Actions workflow step has neither a gateway session nor a way to obtain one, so it authenticates itself: `AccessControlStrategy.OPEN_ROUTE`, an `Authorization: Bearer` token compared with `MessageDigest.isEqual`, a 64 KB body cap, and a 404 until a token exists. The token is generated gateway-side (`GitRunnerRecord.generateToken`), stored encrypted, and returned exactly once — nothing reads it back. Reads require `PermissionType.READ`, mutations `WRITE`; the acting author is `RequestContext.getActor()`. The frontend lives in `web-ui/` and is built from the standard `@inductiveautomation/ignition-web-ui` components (`DataGrid`, `Chip`, `Button`, `PageHeader`, `Modal`, `Loading`, `Tooltip`, and the drawer/form set `Drawer`/`DrawerTemplate`/`Card`/`Form`/`FormControlInput`/`Radio`/`SelectInput`/`TextInput`/`TextArea`/`TextAutocomplete`) — imported through `src/webui.ts`, a one-line shim that re-exports them cast to `any` (the package publishes strict internal prop types, e.g. `DataGrid` requires `paginationParams`/`setTableQueryParams` that have runtime defaults; the shim lets us pass only the props we need, mirroring the storybook examples). RTK Query targets a single `BASE` constant in `src/config.ts` (adjust if the live route prefix differs from `/data/git-config`); the base query lazily fetches `/csrf` and attaches the `X-CSRF-Token` header on mutations (the gateway's web-session access control rejects unsafe methods without it). Webpack emits a UMD bundle to `mounted/gitConfig.js`, packed into the gateway jar via `modlImplementation(project(":web-ui"))`, served at `/res/git-config/gitConfig.js`, and mounted as component `GitConfigPage`.

**Project Browser change badges** (`GitChangeBadges`, Gaskony fork 07/09/2026) — resources that are
changed and not yet committed carry a coloured dot in the Designer's Project Browser: green created,
red deleted, orange modified, orange on an ancestor folder that contains changes. The platform has
the right mechanism (`AbstractNavTreeNode.addBadges(BadgeTreeCellRenderer, boolean)`, and the
Designer ships badges of this kind already — concurrent users, overridden, notes) but no way to
badge nodes we do not own, so the tree's cell renderer is **wrapped**: the wrapper delegates, then
calls `addBadge` on what comes back. That is sound because `PanelBasedTreeCellRenderer
.getTreeCellRendererComponent` returns `this` and Swing paints it afterwards — verified in bytecode
AND asserted at runtime (`c != delegate` → leave the row alone). The frame comes from
`DockingManager.getFrame("Project Browser")` cast to `NavTreePanel`, whose `getTree()` is public.
**No new RPC**: `DesignerHook.refreshCommitPanel` feeds the badges the same `getUncommitedChanges`
dataset the Commit panel polls, so the tree can never disagree with the Changes list beside it; the
dataset's `resource` column is already a resource-path string, which is exactly what
`AbstractResourceNavTreeNode.getResourcePath()` reports, so no path translation is needed.
**Deletions have no node to badge.** A deleted resource is removed from the tree, so a red dot on
the resource itself is impossible; the roll-up carries the severity instead, and a folder holding a
deleted child reads red rather than orange. Without that a deletion was invisible in the tree while
the Commit panel beside it listed it. The dataset's type vocabulary is `Created` / `Uncommitted` /
`Deleted` — `Uncommitted`, not `Modified`, so it used to badge correctly only by falling through the
default branch; the mapping is explicit now and an unknown type logs once.
**Badge ordering is not a preference**: the badge must be added AFTER the delegate has built the
row. The delegate clears its badge list at the start of `getTreeCellRendererComponent`, so adding
beforehand paints nothing at all, ever — measured, not assumed.
**Known limit**: `PerspectiveNavNode` / `VisionModuleNode` are not resource nodes and report no
path, so a change under them shows from the first resource-backed folder downwards, not on the
module root. Every lookup is guarded — if a future 8.3.x moves these internals the badges vanish
and nothing else breaks. Verified in the real Designer 07/09/2026.
**The dot is drawn by a border, NOT by `addBadge`** — this is the important one. The platform's
badge API looks like the right door and is not: the badge list belongs to the delegate, and after
the first commit of a Designer session it stops painting what we put in it. Instrumented, not
guessed: poll still running, state map still right, live tree still rendering through our wrapper,
`addBadge` still called for every affected row, nothing on screen until the Designer was reopened.
Two fixes were built and measured and neither worked — adding the badge *before* the delegate
renders paints nothing at all (it clears the list on entry), and `treeDidChange()` to drop cached
row bounds changed nothing. A `DotBorder` sidesteps the delegate: Swing paints a border as part of
the component and its insets reserve the width. Verified across two commit-then-change cycles.
**Don't "simplify" this back to `addBadge`.**

**Automation** (`gateway/.../automation/`, Gaskony fork 09/09/2026, inbound-only since 3.0.0
14/09/2026) — the Automation page only brings changes into this gateway; nothing on it pushes. Every commit,
push, pull, config auto-commit and scheduled/runner sync raises a `GitEvent`, successes and
failures alike. `GitEvents` is a synchronous, log-only ring buffer — no queue, no worker thread: it
counts `fired`/`failures` and inserts into the 50-entry deque behind the page's Event log inside a
try/catch, so `fire()` can still never throw or block the git operation that called it. It is the
**only** record of what an unattended sync did.

Only `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `autocommit` and `sync` are ever actually raised — `fetch`,
`checkout`, `branch` and `revert` used to be listed as event types but were never wired to fire
one, and were dropped in 3.0.0. A runner-requested pull logs as a `sync` event, same as a scheduled
one.

- `SyncScheduler` fetches on a per-project interval and fast-forwards when the tracked branch moves,
  then `importProject` + a project scan. It **refuses a dirty working tree** rather than discarding
  someone's unsaved work, and refuses an unborn repo rather than materialising a project unattended.

**Polling is the inbound mechanism, deliberately.** An inbound GitHub webhook receiver was built in
2.13.0 and removed in 2.14.0: a webhook is GitHub opening a connection *to* the gateway, and a
credential cannot create an inbound route — an HTTPS token or SSH key authenticates the gateway
calling *out*. `docs/AUTOMATION.md` carries the full reasoning. Do not rebuild it without a gateway
GitHub can actually reach.

**Push-time sync goes through a runner, not a webhook** (2.16.0). A GitHub Actions **self-hosted
runner** connects *out* to GitHub and is handed workflow jobs on that same connection, so the
workflow step can call the gateway from inside the network — the direction that already works.
`RunnerSetup` generates the setup (`config.sh` with the project's own repository URL and the runner
labels, the workflow YAML targeting those labels, and a reachability `curl`); `RunnerTrigger` is the
route the runner calls. The four values involved — repository, labels, gateway address, token — have
to agree across two systems and three files, and one being subtly wrong queues a workflow forever
with no error, which is what the generator exists to prevent. **The workflow trigger is the
project's own branch, not `main`** — project-init creates `master`, so a hardcoded `main` produced a
workflow that never fired and never errored (found by running the loop against a real repository,
fixed in 2.18.0).

A runner-requested sync runs **even when the project's scheduled sync is disabled**: turning the
timer off says "pull on demand only", not "never pull". The module deliberately does not install or
supervise the runner — a runner executes whatever the workflow says, so hosting one from inside the
module would put repository-supplied shell next to the project store under the gateway's identity,
and would need a stored GitHub admin credential for hourly registration tokens.

**A runner pull needs a `GitSyncRecord` even with its timer off** (3.0.0) — the runner route reads
that record's branch and credential rather than carrying its own, so `GET /runner` reports
`hasSync` for the selected project and the web-ui warns and disables *Commit the workflow* until one
exists; without it the runner route 404s. `RunnerSetup.RUNNER_VERSION` is `2.337.0` (3.0.0, was
2.328.0), and the generated workflow has **two steps gated on `runner.os`** (bash/curl, and
pwsh/`Invoke-RestMethod`) rather than one bash step — a Windows self-hosted runner's default shell
is pwsh, and the single bash step failed there — so
`RunnerSetup` also emits `installScriptWindows`, the PowerShell equivalent of the Linux install
block, for a Windows runner machine. It emits `testCommandWindows` beside `testCommand` for the
reachability check too: on Windows PowerShell 5.1 `curl` is an alias for `Invoke-WebRequest`.

`POST /runner-workflow` writes `.github/workflows/ignition-sync.yml` into the project folder and
commits it through `GatewayScriptModule.commitImpl`, so it raises the same `commit` event and lands
in the same history as any other commit. The project folder IS the repository root, which is the
only place GitHub reads workflows from; the leading dot keeps `.github` out of Ignition's resource
scan (verified on 8.3.8 — no scan error, project stays healthy). It refuses to overwrite a
differing workflow and reports `unchanged` rather than making an empty commit.

**Image snapshot is scoped and merges** (`GitImageManager`) — two things that were both wrong:
- **`getImages(path)` lists ONE level of the store and returns folders as entries** with a null
  format and no bytes. The old export iterated the root listing and wrote every entry to disk, so on
  8.3 it produced a single empty file named after the top folder and exported no image at all
  (measured on 8.3.8, where the whole root listing is the one entry `Builtin`). It walks the tree
  now, with depth and entry caps.
- **Import merges; it never deletes.** The store is gateway-scoped, so clearing it before upload
  made one project's `images/` authoritative for every other project — a project with no snapshot
  wiped the platform's ~700 Builtin icons. An image dropped from a project therefore stays on the
  gateway, which is the deliberate trade.

**The React inputs paint their own labels** (`web-ui/src/pages/GitConfig/fields.tsx`) — the
platform's `TextInput`/`SelectInput`/`TextArea` accept a `label` and render it only into MUI's
notched-outline legend, which ships at opacity 0. Every bare field was unlabelled on screen with the
text present in the DOM. Import those three from `./fields`, not from `../../webui`.

**`Radio` is a radio GROUP**, not one radio: it takes a `radios` array and maps over it. Passing
`label`/`checked` as if it were a single control reads `.map` on undefined and takes the whole page
to "Application Error" — that shipped in the Credentials tab from 2.11.0 to 2.13.0. Same family as
`SelectInput` needing `values` (not `options`), and `SelectInput.onChange` handing back MUI's event
rather than the value (hence `selectValue.ts`). **Sweep every tab and every form in a browser before
releasing**; a wrong prop on a platform component is invisible until the page is opened.

**Designer popups** are Swing `JDialog`s parented to the Designer frame (`SwingUtilities.getWindowAncestor(parent)` so they overlay correctly on macOS fullscreen); abstract callbacks are overridden in anonymous subclasses inside `GitActionManager`. Concrete RPC signatures and callback names live in the code — don't duplicate them here.
- `CommitPopup` — pick changes + message; "Amend last commit" pre-fills the last message and allows message-only amend; double-click a row → diff.
- `DiffViewerPopup` — side-by-side LCS line diff (green added / red removed, synced scroll); default headers HEAD/Working Tree, overridable (used by `MergeConflictPopup` and `CommitDetailPopup`).
- `CommitDetailPopup` — files in one commit + Checkout / Revert Commit; double-click a file → historical diff.
- `MergeConflictPopup` — per-file Accept Ours/Theirs, conflict diff, global Accept-All/Abort/Complete; window-close confirms abort so the repo can't be left conflicted.
- `PullPopup` / `PushPopup` / `FetchPopup` — remote selector; the lightweight Push/Fetch popups only appear with 2+ remotes (single-remote acts immediately).
- `BranchPopup` — local/remote lists, header icon buttons (create / refresh / refresh-from-remote), context-menu checkout/delete, current branch highlighted.
- `CreateBranchPopup` — branch name + Create (always from HEAD).
- `InitRepoPopup` — `CardLayout` wizard: Choose → Remote (URI + credential dropdown filtered by URI scheme + Configure…) or Local (no fields; commit email comes from the Ignition user profile). Only a credential FK is passed, never inline credentials.
- `RemotesPopup` — `CardLayout` list/form for named remotes; the form picks a saved credential (stores `SshKeyId`/`HttpsCredentialId` FK) and can open `UserCredentialsPopup` inline. Reached from the status-bar remotes button; the status-bar user icon opens `UserCredentialsPopup` directly (no per-project email popup).
- `UserCredentialsPopup` — user-level SSH keys + per-host HTTPS credentials, with provider hint text (GitHub/GitLab PAT, Azure PAT/empty-username, Bitbucket App Password).
- `InitProgressDialog` — modal indeterminate progress used for long ops (init/push/pull/fetch/snapshot/branch-refresh) so the EDT stays responsive.

**Dockable Commit panel** (`CommitPanel.java`, JIDE `DockableFrame`, tabbed by Project Browser): inline commit (message + amend), a Changes table (checkbox / Resource / Type with color-coded A/M/D/U badges and a `SelectAllHeader` guarded against O(n²) cascades), double-click diff, right-click View Diff / Discard. The Changes header has three snapshot buttons ("Tags"/"Themes"/"Images", `VectorIcons.get("project-update")` glyph) plus a refresh button; the snapshot buttons call `rpc.snapshotTags/Themes/Images` via `GitActionManager.runSnapshot(...)` on a `SwingWorker`+`InitProgressDialog`, then refresh — gateway-side edits then appear as normal file changes for per-file commit selection. Auto-refreshes every 15s and after each git op; `setChangesData` posts to the EDT.

**Dockable History panel** (`HistoryPanel.java`): commit log for the current branch *plus the upstream tracking branch* (so fetched commits show with remote ref badges before merge); borderless toolbar Refresh/Push/Fetch/Pull; Refs column rendered as colored badges; double-click → `CommitDetailPopup`; right-click → Checkout/Revert; "Load More" pagination; thread-safe `setData`.

**Manager classes** (`gateway`):
- `GitManager` — core JGit operations:
  - clone; fetch (remote-tracking refs only, `setUnshallow(true)` to backfill history on depth-1 repos); pull; push (current branch only by default, with `pushAllBranches`/`pushTags`/`forcePush` flags; non-fast-forward rejection → force-push confirmation in the Designer); commit (`amend`); status; branch list/create/checkout/delete with per-branch stash/restore; checkout commit (detached HEAD; `getCurrentBranch()` returns short-hash + "(detached)"); diff extraction; history log with ref decorations; commit file list/diff; discard; revert (aborts cleanly on conflict); remote list/add/remove/setUrl.
  - **Lean init fetch**: `materializeRepo` (the registration-time clone, given the URL as a parameter) does `lsRemote().setHeads(true)` to detect the default branch with no object download, a targeted single-branch shallow fetch for a fast checkout, then an unshallow fetch for full history. `detectDefaultBranchFromRefs` prefers main/master/develop, else the first head ref. `setupLocalRepoImpl` is now just an idempotent startup guard (no persisted URL to re-clone from).
  - **Auth** (`setAuthentication`, the sole auth path): every remote must have an explicit credential FK — `GitRemoteCredentialsRecord.SshKeyId` or `HttpsCredentialId` referencing a user-level `GitUserSshKeyRecord` / `GitUserHttpsCredentialRecord`. Throws with a clear "pick a credential in the Remotes popup" message if no FK is set or the referenced credential is gone. Auth type (SSH vs HTTPS) is read from the remote URL in `.git/config`. Push/pull take a `remoteName` used for both the JGit target and credential lookup. Remote-dependent ops are guarded by `projectHasRemote()` (backed by `GitManager.listRemotes()` reading `.git/config`) so local-only repos degrade gracefully and user-named (non-origin) remotes are recognized.
  - **Pull conflict sentinel**: `pullImpl` throws `RuntimeException("MERGE_CONFLICT:" + files)` on `MergeStatus.CONFLICTING`, caught by the Designer's `handlePullAction` to open `MergeConflictPopup`.
  - **Metadata noise suppression**: `resource.json`/`thumbnail.png` are filtered from the changes list and commit file list when no sibling source file in the same resource dir also changed; applied in `getUncommitedChangesImpl`/`getCommitFilesImpl`.
- `GitProjectManager` / `GitTagManager` / `GitThemeManager` / `GitImageManager` — project resource import, and gateway-resource snapshot (tags/themes/images) into the project tree. The theme snapshot stages into a system temp dir and only swaps into `themes/` on full success (a mid-copy failure can't destroy committed theme files); tag snapshot bounds the provider read with a 30s timeout.

**Persistence** — eight resource types on the 8.3 resource/config system. Each `*Record` class is now a mutable DTO façade over a nested `NamedResourceHandler`: the config is an inner Java `record`, and the resource name is `String.valueOf(numeric id)` so the RPC contract and Designer UI are unchanged (numeric long ids preserved). `GatewayHook` registers a `ResourceTypeMeta` per type and starts the handlers. A one-time `records.legacy.GitLegacyImporter` runs on first 8.3 startup: it registers the old SimpleORM tables' metas via `SchemaUpdater` (using minimal *public top-level* `Legacy*` `PersistentRecord` classes), reads each row, writes it as a resource, deletes the legacy row, and is idempotent (skips if the resource already exists; absent legacy tables on a fresh install are skipped). The eight types:
- `GitProjectsConfigRecord` — project registration marker (`id` + `projectName` + `imagePrefix`). `imagePrefix` names the ONE folder of the gateway image store this project versions, and is empty by default, meaning it versions none — see the image-snapshot note below. Holds no remote/URI data: `.git/config` is the sole source of truth for remotes. The clone URL is passed as a parameter to `initializeProject` and consumed by `materializeRepo` at registration time; it is never persisted. (Legacy 8.1 rows migrate identity only; their URI is dropped.)
- `GitReposUsersRecord` — project↔user registration marker only (commit email comes from the Ignition user profile; auth is via the credential records).
- `GitRemoteCredentialsRecord` — per (project, user, remote); holds `SshKeyId`/`HttpsCredentialId` FKs into the user-level credential tables.
- `GitUserSshKeyRecord` — user-level SSH key (`IgnitionUser`, `KeyName`); the key is a `SecretConfig` (`sshKeySecret`) — embedded-encrypted or a Secret-Provider reference, same as the HTTPS password — with the legacy plaintext `sshKey` kept nullable so pre-migration rows still deserialize and upgrade on next save; `getSSHKey()` decrypts/falls-back unchanged for Designer callers. Shared across projects/remotes.
- `GitConfigRemoteRecord` — gateway-level singleton: the data-dir config repo's remote (URI, branch, credential FK). Manual push only.
- `GitSyncRecord` — per-project scheduled inbound sync (remote, branch, interval, the Ignition user whose credential authenticates it).
- `GitRunnerRecord` — gateway-level singleton: whether the GitHub Actions runner route is open, the bearer token as a `SecretConfig`, the gateway address the runner should call, and the runner labels. The address is asked for rather than derived: the gateway knows the address a browser reached it on, which behind a container or proxy is routinely not the one a machine on the plant network would use.
- `GitUserHttpsCredentialRecord` — user-level HTTPS credential (`IgnitionUser`, `HostPattern`, `UserName`, `Password`). The password is held as a `SecretConfig.embedded(...)`: encrypted on `setPassword` via `GatewayContext.getSystemEncryptionService().encryptToJson(Plaintext)` and decrypted on `getPassword` via `Secret.create(ctx, secretConfig).getPlaintext()`. `HostPattern` is purely an organizational label / disambiguator in the credential picker — auth never matches on it; remotes resolve credentials only via their explicit FK.

**`records.legacy.RetiredResourceCleanup`** (3.0.0) — deletes the retired `git-automation`,
`git-trigger` and `git-webhook` (left over from the 2.14.0 removal) resources once on startup,
before `ConfigAutoCommitter` attaches, and commits the deletion as one config-repository commit.
Follows the `GitLegacyImporter` pattern: it registers minimal metas for the three retired types
first, because a resource of an unregistered type is never decoded by the resource system and
nothing else would ever remove it from the versioned config. Logs the counts, never blocks
startup. A resource it fails to delete is logged at WARN (a token may still be on disk and in the
config repo) and retried next start; a redundant backup node refuses local writes and logs the
same, while the master's delete replicates to it.

### Key libraries

- **Eclipse JGit 6.10.1** — all git operations
- **Apache MINA sshd** (`org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache`) — SSH transport (replaced the deprecated JSch backend)
- **Lombok 1.18.42** — annotation processing (designer)
- **IntelliJ forms_rt 7.0.3** — Swing form support for popups
- **React 18 + RTK Query + `@inductiveautomation/ignition-web-ui`** — the `web-ui/` gateway page (externals provided by the gateway; not bundled), built via `com.github.node-gradle.node` + webpack into a UMD bundle

## Module Packaging

`io.ia.sdk.modl` plugin (v0.4.1). Module ID `com.operametrix.ignition.git`; version is `2.0.0.<yyyyMMddHH>` (the build appends a timestamp). The compile SDK (`sdk_version = 8.3.6`, latest stable) is deliberately decoupled from `requiredIgnitionVersion` (`min_ignition_version = 8.3.0`) so the `.modl` installs on any 8.3.x gateway — don't recouple them. 8.3 declares module deps via `moduleDependencySpecs { }` (empty here), replacing the old `moduleDependencies`. The `:web-ui` subproject has **no module scope** (it's not in `projectScopes`); its built bundle is pulled into the gateway jar via `modlImplementation(project(":web-ui"))` in `gateway/build.gradle.kts`, and `settings.gradle` adds the Node.js ivy repo so the node-gradle plugin can fetch the Node runtime. `skipModlSigning` is `false` (signing enabled) — copy `gradle.template.properties` to `gradle.properties` (gitignored) and fill in signing credentials, or flip `skipModlSigning` to `true` locally for unsigned dev builds.

## Java Version
