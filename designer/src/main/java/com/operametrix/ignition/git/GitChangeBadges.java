/**
 * Marks resources in the Designer's Project Browser that have changed and are not yet committed,
 * the way an editor marks dirty files.
 *
 * <p>The platform already has the right mechanism for this: every node implements
 * {@code AbstractNavTreeNode.addBadges(BadgeTreeCellRenderer, boolean)}, and the Designer ships
 * badges of exactly this kind (concurrent users, overridden resource, notes). What it does not
 * offer is a way to badge nodes we do not own — a Perspective view's node belongs to the
 * Perspective module. So this wraps the tree's cell renderer instead: the wrapper delegates
 * rendering, then puts a {@link DotBorder} on the component that comes back, and Swing draws the
 * dot as part of that component.
 *
 * <p>None of this is a documented extension point, so every lookup is guarded: if the Designer's
 * internals move, the badges quietly disappear and nothing else breaks.
 *
 * <p><b>Deletions have no node.</b> When a resource is deleted the Designer removes it from the
 * tree, so there is nothing left to badge and a red dot on the resource itself is impossible. The
 * roll-up is therefore the only way a deletion can be seen at all, and it carries the severity up:
 * a folder holding a deleted child reads red rather than the ordinary orange. Without that a
 * deletion was completely invisible in the Project Browser while the Commit panel beside it listed
 * the change.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a border and not {@code addBadge}.</b> The platform's own badge API looked like the
 * right door and is not: the badge list belongs to the delegate, and after the first commit of a
 * Designer session it stops painting what we put in it. That was instrumented, not guessed -- the
 * poll still ran, the state map was still right, the live tree was still rendering through our
 * wrapper, {@code addBadge} was still called for every affected row, and nothing appeared until the
 * Designer was reopened. Two plausible fixes were built and measured and neither worked: adding the
 * badge before the delegate renders paints nothing at all (it clears the list on entry), and
 * {@code treeDidChange()} to drop cached row bounds changed nothing. Drawing the dot ourselves in a
 * {@link DotBorder} sidesteps the delegate entirely -- Swing paints a border as part of the
 * component and its insets reserve the width, so the row is measured with room for the dot rather
 * than clipping it.
 *
 * <p><b>Known limit.</b> The mark rolls up to ancestor folders by resource path, so a collapsed
 * folder still shows that something inside it changed — but only for folders that ARE resource
 * nodes. Several top-level module folders are not ({@code PerspectiveNavNode} and
 * {@code VisionModuleNode} report no resource path at all), so a change under one of those is
 * visible from the first resource-backed folder downwards and not on the module root itself:
 * Scripting -> Project Library carries the roll-up dot, Perspective does not.
